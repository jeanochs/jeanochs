# Some Commmon Problems that I Encounter

## "Permission Denied": Attempting to Connect to a Serial Device

1. Check permissions (ensure that the read and write bits are set)
2. Add "dialout" to users group.
   ```
   #!/bin/bash

   sudo adduser $USER dialout
   ```

## Cannot Program the Arduino Nano ESP32-S3 Using the Out-of-Box Upload command from the Arduino CLI

The normal `arduino-cli upload` command does not do well when attemtping to program the ESP32-S3. Instead, I have opted to compile the files and output the binary files to a seperate folder, which the actual esptool will flash the ESP32-S3 with. The workflow looks somewhat like this:

```
# Make a seperate folder 'bin' or whatever your choice is
mkdir bin

# Now, compile the sketch and put the bins into the 'bin' folder
arduino-cli compile -b arduino:esp32:nano_nora --build-path bin/

# Use esptool.py to load the bins to the ESP32
# Note the memory locations used for this command:
#       0x0000 -> Bootloader Memory Address
#       0x8000 -> Partition Table
#       0xe000 -> Boot App (if present)
#       0x10000 -> Main Application (your sketch)
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port /your/port --baud 921600 write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_size detect \
   0x0000 ./bin/YOUR_SKETCH.ino.bootloader.bin \
   0x8000 ./bin/YOUR_SKETCH.ino.partitions.bin \
   0xe000 ./bin/boot_app0.bin \ # May be an optional bin that appears; have not encountered it yet. This will not always be visible. 
   0x10000 ./bin/YOUR_SKETCH.ino.bin
```

This has worked for me and replicates the behavior of the Arduino IDE. I'll probrobly write a bash script for this at some point because I need this to be automated. 

## Manually adding Vim plugin help

If one is installing Vim plugins manually, the help files will need to be loaded in this manner:

```
# We are assuming that the plugin has been moved to .vim/pack/{plugin}/start/
# We are naviagting to the docs folder just to ensure that it exists
$ cd .vim/pack/{plugin}/start/{plugin}/doc
```

Back in Vim, run the command `:helptags .vim/pack/{plugin}/start/{plugin}/doc`. From here, the files *should* be accessible via help.
