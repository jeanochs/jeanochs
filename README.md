# Hello! I am Jalani Eanochs, a graduate mechanical engineering student with a specialization in computational mechanics.

A little about me...

1. Known programming languages: C/C++, Python.
2. Currently learning: how to program a PIC microcontroller without a IDE (masochistic, I know).

## My Ongoing Programming/Computational Projects
**Computational Mechanics**: Finite Element Simulation of Ion Diffusion across Crystals of Litihum Ion Battery
**Embedding Programming**: Autonomous Systm for Beginning Seed Growth

<!--I am not too hard to find. My socials:-->

<!--Need to get Instagram, LinkedIn, Youtube (maybe)
