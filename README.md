# Hello! I am Jalani Eanochs, a graduate mechanical engineering student with a specialization in computational mechanics.

I am moonlight as a fledging software engineer, with the majority of my expertise being in embedded and scientic programming. 
I am trying to learn how to be a better web developer so I can become a full-stack engineer.

A little about me...

1. Technologies and Frameworks: AWS (specifically EC2 and S3), Git (of course), Tkinter (Python)
2. Programmming (and markup) languages (in order of familiarty): C/C++, Python, HTML, Javascript, CSS
3. Currently learning: 6502 assembly (just for the sake of learning) and the basics of kernel development.

## My Ongoing Programming/Computational Projects
**Computational Mechanics**: Finite Element Simulation of Ion Diffusion across Crystals of Litihum Ion Battery
