# Hello! I am Jalani Eanochs, a graduate mechanical engineering student and struggling programmer. 

A little about me...

1. Known programming languages: C/C++, Python, Visual Basic (incredibly rusty, though)
2. Currently learning: how to program a PIC microcontroller without a IDE (masochistic, I know).
3. Current Project: Control System for Capstone Project

<!--I am not too hard to find. My socials:-->

<!--Need to get Instagram, LinkedIn, Youtube (maybe)
